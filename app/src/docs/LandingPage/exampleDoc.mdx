# Introduction to Streamr APIs
Streamr provides a set of APIs to enable easy integration with other systems. The APIs cover data input, data output, and managing various resources within Streamr (such as Canvases, Dashboards, and Streams).

There are RESTful HTTP endpoints that can be accessed using any HTTP library with ease. Streaming data output is available over websockets. For easy usage, we offer a Javascript client that works in the browser as well as node.js. The client is available on npm. Clients for other languages are coming soon.

#### Authentication
You authenticate to all the RESTful API endpoints using your user API key, found on your profile page. Include the following header on your HTTP request:

<Logo color='purple' opacity='1' />

### Authorization: token your-api-key

When reading from or writing to Streams, you can use a Stream-specific anonymous key instead of your user key to avoid exposing it. Anonymous keys can be managed on the Stream edit page.

## Data Input
Data Input via HTTP
You can write events to streams by POSTing JSON objects to the below API endpoint. The body of the request should be a JSON object, encoded in UTF-8, containing the key-value pairs representing your data. You can also send a JSON list (of objects), if you want to push multiple events in one HTTP request (they will all get the same timestamp).

### Authorization: token your-api-key

When reading from or writing to Streams, you can use a Stream-specific anonymous key instead of your user key to avoid exposing it. Anonymous keys can be managed on the Stream edit page.

## Data Input
Data Input via HTTP
You can write events to streams by POSTing JSON objects to the below API endpoint. The body of the request should be a JSON object, encoded in UTF-8, containing the key-value pairs representing your data. You can also send a JSON list (of objects), if you want to push multiple events in one HTTP request (they will all get the same timestamp).

The number of inputs can be set in module options, and the values at the inputs will be included in the email content. The inputs can be renamed to give them more descriptive names.  \n\n\n\nWhen running against historical data, emails are not actually sent. Instead, a notification is shown representing the would-be email. Emails are capped at one per minute to avoid accidental self-spamming.  \n\n\n\nHere's an example of email content:  \n\n\n\n\nMessage:  \n\n(your custom message)\n  \n  \n\nEvent Timestamp:  \n\n2014-11-18 10:30:00.124\n  \n  \n\nInput Values:  \n\nvalue1: 7357  \n\nvalue2: test value"

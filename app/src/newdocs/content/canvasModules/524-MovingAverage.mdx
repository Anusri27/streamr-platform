### MovingAverage

This module calculates the simple moving average (MA, SMA) of values arriving at the input. Each value is assigned equal weight. The moving average is calculated based on a sliding window of adjustable length.

**Inputs**
**in**
Input values


**Outputs**
**out**
The moving average


**Parameters**
**minSamples**
Minimum number of input values received before a value is output
**length**
Length of the sliding window, ie. the number of most recent input values to include in calculation

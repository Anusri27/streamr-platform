This module is the main tool for visualizing time series. The chart is updated on fly as new data becomes available. You can zoom the chart by dragging over the area you want to zoom to. To pan the chart while zoomed, use the <span class="highlight">navigator</span> below the chart. Individual series can be toggled on or off by clicking on the series name in the <span class="highlight">legend</span>. Also note that the chart module can be resized by dragging from its lower right corner.
  


Each input series is drawn on y-axis 1 by default. You can edit y-axis assignments by clicking the button beside the input endpoint.
  


The number of inputs is adjustable in the module <span class="highlight">options</span> (the wrench icon). Other options include ignoring data points outside a certain time of day.
  


The module can also produce a downloadable CSV file containing whatever data points are sent to the chart. To use this feature, run in CSV export mode by selecting that option from the Run button dropdown menu.

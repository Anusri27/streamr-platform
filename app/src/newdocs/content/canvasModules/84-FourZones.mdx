### FourZones

This module waits for the input signal to reach either the <span class="highlight">highTrigger</span> or <span class="highlight">lowTrigger</span> level. Either 1 or -1 is output respectively. The triggered value is kept until it is set back to 0 at the corresponding release level.
  


If you set <span class="highlight">mode</span> to <span class="highlight">exit</span>, the output will trigger when exiting the trigger level instead of entering it.

**Inputs**

**highRelease**

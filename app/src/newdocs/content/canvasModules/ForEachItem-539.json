The input lists are iterated element-wise, and the sub-canvas is executed every time a value is available for each input list. If input list sizes vary, the sub-canvas is executed as many times as the smallest list is of size. After the input lists have been iterated through, and the sub-canvas activated accordingly, lists of produced values are sent to output lists.  \n\n   \n\nThe output *numOfItems* indicates how many times the sub-canvas was executed, i.e., the size of the smallest input list.  \n\n   \n\nYou may want to look into the module **RepeatItem** when using this module to repeat parameter values etc."

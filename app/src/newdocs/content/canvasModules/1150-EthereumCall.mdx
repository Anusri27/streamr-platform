### EthereumCall

Call Ethereum smart contract.  

First, connect Ethereum contract into **contract**Â input. You can write your own using SolidityModule, or pick a template such as PayByUse.  

Second, choose the **function** you want to call from the dropdown. There are two kinds of functions calls:  


- constant function calls that return results directly, and- transactions that return values through events that the function call invokes.
The contract must be deployed before this module can activate.

**Inputs**
**contract**
Ethereum contract
**trigger**
Send call (for functions that have no inputs)
**ether**
ETH to send with the function call (for <i>payable</i> functions)


**Outputs**
**errors**
List of error messages


**Parameters**
**ethAccount**
The account used to make transaction or call
**function**
The contract function to invoke

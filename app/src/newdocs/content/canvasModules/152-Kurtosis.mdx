### Kurtosis

Calculates the kurtosis (or fourth standardized moment) of a distribution of values in a sliding window. Kurtosis is a measure of the "peakedness" of a distribution.
  


Note that at least 4 samples is required to calculate kurtosis.

**Inputs**
**in**
Input random variable


**Outputs**
**out**
Kurtosis


**Parameters**
**minSamples**
Number of samples required to produce output. At least 4 samples are required to calculate kurtosis
**windowLength**
Length of the sliding window of values

This module can be used to sample values from one timeseries upon events from another timeseries, just like the Sampler module.
  


However the <span class="highlight">triggerIf</span> value must be equal to 1 for the value at <span class="highlight">value</span> input to be sent out. Trigger events with other values than 1 will produce no effect.

### Peak

Attempts to detect upward turns below <span class="highlight">lowZone</span> (outputs 1) and downward turns below <span class="highlight">highZone</span> (outputs -1).
  


For an upward turn to be registered, the change between subsequent input values must be larger than <span class="highlight">threshold</span>. For a downward turn the change must be less than <span class="highlight">-threshold</span>.

**Inputs**
**in**
Input time series


**Outputs**
**out**
1 for upward turn and -1 for downward turn


**Parameters**
**highZone**
The level above which a downward turn can occur
**lowZone**
The level below which an upward turn can occur
**threshold**
The minimum change in the correct direction between subsequent input values that is allowed to trigger a turn

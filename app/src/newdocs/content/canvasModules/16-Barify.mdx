### Barify

This is a utility for moving from event time to wall-clock time. This module outputs new values every <span class="highlight">barLength</span> seconds. You would use this module to sample a time series every 60 seconds, for example.

**Inputs**
**in**

**Outputs**
**open**
Value at start of period
**high**
Maximum value during period
**avg**

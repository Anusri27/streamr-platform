### Email

The Email module can be used to send notifications to your email address. Just like any module, it activates when an event is received at any driving input. The number of inputs can be set in module options, and the values at the inputs will be included in the email content. The inputs can be renamed to give them more descriptive names.  



When running against historical data, emails are not actually sent. Instead, a notification is shown representing the would-be email. Emails are capped at one per minute to avoid accidental self-spamming.  



Here's an example of email content:  




Message:  

(your custom message)
  
  

Event Timestamp:  

2014-11-18 10:30:00.124
  
  

Input Values:  

value1: 7357  

value2: test value







**Parameters**
**subject**
Email Subject
**message**
Custom message to include in the email, optional

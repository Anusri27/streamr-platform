### FlexBarify

Similar to the <span class="highlight">Barify</span> module, which creates open-high-low-close bars equally long in <span class="highlight">time</span>, this module creates bars equally long in an arbitrary variable passed into the <span class="highlight">valueLength</span> input.
  


Incoming <span class="highlight">valueLength</span> is summed for the current bar until <span class="highlight">barLength</span> is reached, at which point the outputs are sent and the bar is reset.
  


Note that if multiple bars would be filled on the same event, only one is output. To avoid this situation you may want to keep <span class="highlight">barLength</span> substantially larger than incoming <span class="highlight">valueLength</span>.

**Inputs**
**value**
Value to be sampled into the bar
**valueLength**
Length of each event, contributes to <span class='highlight'>barLength</span>


**Outputs**
**open**
Value at start of period
**high**
Maximum value during period
**avg**
Average of values received during the period, weighted by <span class='highlight'>valueLength</span>
**low**
Minimum value during period
**close**
Value at end of period (the most recent value)


**Parameters**
**barLength**
Length of each bar (in <span class='highlight'>valueLength</span> units)

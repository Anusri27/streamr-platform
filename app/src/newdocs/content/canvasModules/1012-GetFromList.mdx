### GetFromList

Fetch item from a list by index.  

Indexing starts from zero, so the first item has index 0, second has index 1 etc.  

Negative index counts from end of list, so that last item in the list has index -1, second-to-last has index -2 etc.

**Inputs**
**in**

**Outputs**
**out**
Item found at given index
**error**
Error message, e.g. <i>List is empty</i>


**Parameters**
**index**
Index in the list for the item to be fetched. Negative index counts from end of list.
